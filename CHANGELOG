0.19	8 October 2007
	Argh, 0.18 broke on 5.005 because of new style open().  Now rephrased	
	to old-style open() using globs.

0.18	7 October 2007
	Changed Makefile.PL to quit before attempting to install to kill all
	cpan-tester messages where Cache::Memcached::Managed is being tested
	without "memcached" being available and executable.  No changes made
	to the code.

0.17	3 October 2007
	Methods "add", "decr", "incr", "replace" and "set" now accept a third
	unnamed parameter for expiration.  Suggested by John Goulah.

	Fixed test-suite: most problems occurred because "localhost"
	apparently doesn't resolve on most systems anymore, so it couldn't
	find a port to work on.  Now using 127.0.0.1.

	Several other problems occurred because of additional statistics in
	newer versions of memcached.  Marked tests as TODO for now.

	Apparently the handling of dead servers has been improved, so the
	fetch on a dead servers wasn't failing, which was failing the test
	and subsequent statistics tests.  Also marked tests as TODO for now.

	Added "Incompatibility with Cache module" section to CAVEATS.

0.16	2 February 2007
	Updated the test-suite to support version 1.2.1 of memcached.  Brought
	code of test-suite up to PBP standards (code itself will follow in a
	later version).

	Load testing is no longer skipped on OS X, as the latest libevent
	/ memcached combo seems to compile and install cleanly with all
	necessary workarounds installed automagically.  Instead a warning
	is displayed.

	Changed documentation of "flush_all" to point out that the
	"flush_interval.patch" is no longer necessary when using memcached
	1.2.1.

0.15	11 June 2006
	Cache::Memcached changed some of its internals with version 1.16.
	This version now supports both versions before and after.  Spotted
	by islue.

0.14	19 October 2005
	Update VERSION file (forgotten to do that in 0.13)
	Added fix for missing Kwalitee point for not using 'strict'

0.13	23 August 2005
	Added support for Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi, to allow accessing
	multiple managed servers at the same time.

0.12	18 July 2005
	Added "inactive" parameter to "new".  Added
	Cache::Memcached::Managed::Inactive module for the "inactive"
	functionality.  This allows you to make your code in such a way that
	it doesn't make a difference whether or not there is an actual
	memcached server available.

0.11	8 July 2005
	Fixed problem in "group" and "get_multi" when using a non-standard
	delimiter.  Spotted by Torbjørn Køhle

0.10	6 July 2005
	Changed return value of "flush_all" to boolean rather than number
	of servers flushed.  Added support for "flush_interval".  Added
	file "flush_interval.patch" to distribution to add time flush_all
	support to memcached itself.

0.09	5 July 2005
	Further refined the fork checking / dead server logic: connection
	attempts are now made again after 20..30 seconds, instead of never
	in the current process.

	Fixed problem that would cause an empty list to be returned in case
	of failure in list context: this affected "set", "add", "replace",
	"incr" and "decr".  A false value is now returned regardless of
	context.

	4 July 2005
	Completely reworked the fork checking logic.  Child processes of
	parent processes that have been disconnected, now attempt to
	reconnect.

0.08	4 July 2005
	Fixed many documentation problems.  Added default data server
	functionality to "new".  Added "W" to allow expirations to be
	specified by week.

0.07	3 July 2005
	Fixed problem with return value of "start".  Optimized "stats".
	Added stress test related to groups, which unfortunately seems to
	fail on Tiger (with its crippled libevent support).

0.06	1 July 2005
	Fixed problems with relative keys and version support.

0.05	30 June 2005
	Added initial tests for checking behaviour after fork().

0.04	29 June 2005
	Added methods "start", "stop" and "version".  Removed starting /
	stopping logic from testlib.  Adapted test-suite to account for these
	new methods.  Basic testing should now cover all methods (albeit not
	with all parameter combinations yet.

0.03	28 June 2005
	Tweaks and fixes and more tests.

0.02    27 June 2005
	Tweaks and fixes and a much more expanded test-suite.

0.01    26 June 2005
	First public version of Cache::Memcached::Managed.
