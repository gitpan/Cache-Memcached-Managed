0.10	6 July 2005
	Changed return value of "flush_all" to boolean rather than number
	of servers flushed.  Added support for "flush_interval".  Added
	file "flush_interval.patch" to distribution to add time flush_all
	support to memcached itself.

0.09	5 July 2005
	Further refined the fork checking / dead server logic: connection
	attempts are now made again after 20..30 seconds, instead of never
	in the current process.

	Fixed problem that would cause an empty list to be returned in case
	of failure in list context: this affected "set", "add", "replace",
	"incr" and "decr".  A false value is now returned regardless of
	context.

	4 July 2005
	Completely reworked the fork checking logic.  Child processes of
	parent processes that have been disconnected, now attempt to
	reconnect.

0.08	4 July 2005
	Fixed many documentation problems.  Added default data server
	functionality to "new".  Added "W" to allow expirations to be
	specified by week.

0.07	3 July 2005
	Fixed problem with return value of "start".  Optimized "stats".
	Added stress test related to groups, which unfortunately seems to
	fail on Tiger (with its crippled libevent support).

0.06	1 July 2005
	Fixed problems with relative keys and version support.

0.05	30 June 2005
	Added initial tests for checking behaviour after fork().

0.04	29 June 2005
	Added methods "start", "stop" and "version".  Removed starting /
	stopping logic from testlib.  Adapted test-suite to account for these
	new methods.  Basic testing should now cover all methods (albeit not
	with all parameter combinations yet.

0.03	28 June 2005
	Tweaks and fixes and more tests.

0.02    27 June 2005
	Tweaks and fixes and a much more expanded test-suite.

0.01    26 June 2005
