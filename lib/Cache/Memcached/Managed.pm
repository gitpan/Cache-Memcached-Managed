=head1 NAME

Cache::Memcached::Managed - provide API for managing cached information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Cache::Memcached::Managed;

 my $cache = Cache::Memcached::Managed->new( '127.0.0.1:12345' );

 $cache->set( $value );

 $cache->set( $value,$id );

 $cache->set( value      => $value,
              id         => $id,
              key        => $key,
              version    => 1.1,
              namespace  => 'foo',
              expiration => '1D', );

 my $value = $cache->get( $id );

 my $value = $cache->get( id  => $id,
                          key => $key );

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.20.

=head1 DIFFERENCES FROM THE Cache::Memcached API

The Cache::Memcached::Managed module provides an API to values, cached in
one or more memcached servers.  Apart from being very similar to the API
of L<Cache::Memcached>, the Cached::Memcached::Managed API allows for
management of groups of values, for simplified key generation and expiration,
as well as version and namespace management and a few other goodies.

These are the main differences between this module and the L<Cache::Memcached>
module.

=head2 automatic key generation

The calling subroutine provides the key (by default).  Whenever the "get"
and "set" operations occur in the same subroutine, you don't need to think
up an identifying key that will have to be unique across the entire cache.

=head2 ID refinement

An ID can be added to the (automatically) generated key (none is by default),
allowing easy identification of similar data objects (e.g. the primary key of
a Class::DBI object).  If necessary, a unique ID can be created automatically
(useful when logging events).

=head2 version management

The caller's package provides an identifying version (by default), allowing
differently formatted data-structures caused by source code changes, to live
seperately from each other in the cache.

=head2 namespace support

A namespace identifier allows different realms to co-exist in the same cache (the uid by default).  This e.g. allows a group of developers to all use the same cache without interfering with each other.

=head2 group management

A piece of cached data can be assigned to any number of groups.  Cached data
can be retrieved and removed by specifying the group to which the data
belongs.  This can be used to selectively remove cached data that has been
invalidated by a database change, or to obtain logged events of which the
identification is not known (but the group name is).

=head2 easy (default) expiration specification

A default expiration per Cache::Memcached::Managed object can be specified.
Expirations can be used by using mnemonics D, H, M, S, (e.g. '2D3H' would
be 2 days and 3 hours).

=head2 automatic fork() detection

Sockets are automatically reset in forked processes, no manual reset needed.
This allows the module to be used to access cached data during the server
start phase in a mod_perl environment.

=head2 magical increment

Counters are automagically created with L<incr> if they don't exist yet.

=head2 instant invalidation

Support for the new "flush_all" memcached action to invalidate all data in
a cache in one fell swoop.

=head2 dead memcached server detection

An easy way to check whether all related memcached servers are still alive.

=head2 starting/stopping memcached servers

Easy start / stop of indicated memcached servers, mainly intended for
development and testing environments.

=head2 extensive test-suite

An extensive test-suite is included (which is sadly lacking in the
Cache::Memcached distribution).

=head1 BASIC PREMISES

The basic premise is that each piece of information that is to be cached,
can be identified by a L<key>, an optional L<ID>, a L<version> and a
L<namespace>.

The L<key> determines the basic identification of the value to be cached.
The L<ID> specifies a refinement on the basic identification.  The L<version>
ensures that differently formatted values with the same key and ID do not
interfere with each other.  The L<namespace> ensures that different realms
of information (for instance, for different users) do not interfere with each
other.

=head2 key

The default for the key is the fully qualified subroutine name from which
the cached value is accessed.  For instance, if a cached value is to be
accessed from subroutine "bar" in the Foo package, then the key is "Foo::bar".
Explicit keys can be specified and may contain any characters except the
L<delimiter>.

A special case is applicable if the cache is being accessed from the lowest
level in a script.  In that case the default key will be created consisted
of the server name (as determined by C<uname -n>) and the absolute path of
the executing script.

=head2 ID

If no ID is specified for a piece of information, then just the L<key> will be
assumed.  The ID can be any string.  It can for instance be the primary key
of a Class::DBI object.  ID's can be specified as a scalar value, or as list
ref, or as a hash ref (for instance, for multi-keyed Class::DBI objects).

Some examples:

 my $value = $cache->get( $id );

 my $value = $cache->get( [$id,$checkin,$checkout] );

 my $value =
  $cache->get( {id => $id,checkin => $checkin,checkout => $checkout} );

If the ID should be something unique, and you're not interested in the ID
per se (for instance, if you're only interested in the
L<group|"group management"> to which the information will be linked), you
can specify the string C<:unique> to have a unique ID automatically
generated.

=head2 version management

The version indicates which version (generation) of the data is to be fetched
or stored.  By default, it takes the value of the C<$VERSION> variable of the
package to which the L<key> is associated.  This allows new modules that cache
information to be easily installed in a server park without having to fear
data format changes.

A specific version can be specified with each of the L<add>, L<decr>,
L<get>, L<get_multi>, L<incr>, L<replace> and L<set> to indicate the link
with the group of the information being cached.

=head2 namespace management

The namespace indicates the realm to which the data belongs.  By default,
the effective user id of the process (as known by $>) is assumed.  This
allows several users to share the same L<"data server"> and
L<"directory server">, while each still having their own set of cached data.

A specific namespace can be specified with each of the L<add>, L<decr>,
L<get>, L<get_multi>, L<incr>, L<replace> and L<set> to indicate the link
with the group of the information being cached.

=head2 data server

The data server is a Cache::Memcached (compatible) object in which all data
(keyed to a L<"data key">) is stored.  It uses one or more memcached servers.
The data server can be obtained with the L<data> object.

=head2 data key

The data key identifies a piece of data in the L<"data server">.  It is
formed by appending the namespace (by default the user id of the process),
L<version>, L<key> and L<ID>, seperated by the L<delimiter>.

If a scalar value is specified as an ID, then that value is used.

If the ID is specified as a list ref, then the values are concatenated with
the L<delimiter>.

If the ID is specified as a hash ref, then the sorted key and value pairs are
concatenated with the L<delimiter>.

=head2 group management

The group concept was added to allow easier management of cached
information.  Since it is impossible to delete cached information from
the L<"data server"> by a matching a wildcard key value (because you can
only access cached information if you know the exact key), another way was
needed to access groups of cached data.

Another way that would not need another (database) backend or be dependent
on running on a single hardware.  This is achieved by using a
L<"directory server">, which is basically just another memcached server
dedicated to keeping a directory of data kept in the L<"data server">.

The group concept allows you to associate a given L<"data key"> to a named
group and an group ID value (e.g. the group named "group" and the name of an
SQL table).  This information is then stored in the L<"directory server">,
from which it is possible to obtain a list of L<"data keys"> associated with
the group name and the ID value.

In the current implementation, the only one group name is recognized by
default:

=over 2

=item group

Intended for generic data without specific keys.

=back

You can specify your own set of group names with the "group_names"
parameter in L<new>.

Group names and ID's can be specified with each of the L<add>, L<decr>,
L<incr>, L<replace> and L<set> to indicate the link with the group of the
information being cached.

The pseudo group ID 'C<:key>' can be specified to indicate that the key
should be used for the group ID.  This is usually used in conjunction with
the generic 'C<group>' group name

A list of valid group names can be obtained with the L<group_names> method.

=head2 directory server

The directory server is a Cache::Memcached (compatible) object that is being
used to store L<"data key">s (as opposed to the data itself) used in
L<"group management">.  If no L<directory> server was specified, then the
data server will be assumed.

If there are multiple memcached servers used for the L<"data server">, then
it is advised to use a seperate directory server (as a failure in one of
the memcached backend servers will leave you with an incomplete directory
otherwise).

Should the directory server fail, and it is vital that there is no stale data
in the data server, then a L<flush_all> would need to be executed to ensure
that no stale data remains behind.  Of course, this will also delete all
non-stale data from the data server, so your mileage may vary.

=head2 expiration specification

Expiration can be specified in seconds, but, for convenience, can also be
specified in days, hours and minutes (and seconds).  This is indicated by
a number, immediately followed by a letter B<D> (for days) or B<H> (for hours)
or B<M> (for minutes) or B<S> (for seconds).  For example:

 2D3H

means 2 days and 3 hours, which means B<183600> seconds.

=head2 transparent fork handling

Using this module, you do not have to worry if everything will still work
after a fork().  As soon as it is detected that the process has forked, new
handles will be opened to the memcached servers in the child process (so the
meticulous calling of "disconnect_all" of L<Cache::Memcached> is no longer
needed).

Transparent thread handling is still on the todo list.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

 my $cache = Cache::Memcached::Managed->new;

 my $cache = Cache::Memcached::Managed->new( '127.0.0.1:11311' );

 my $cache = Cache::Memcached::Managed->new(
  data           => '127.0.0.1:11311',   # default: '127.0.0.1:11211'
  directory      => '127.0.0.1:11411',   # default: data
  delimiter      => ';',                 # default: '#'
  expiration     => '1H',                # default: '1D'
  flush_interval => 10,                  # default: none
  namespace      => 'foo',               # default: $> ($EUID)
  group_names    => [qw(foo bar)],       # default: ['group']

  memcached_class => 'Cached::Memcached::Fast', # default: 'Cache::Memcached'
 );

 my $cache = Cache::Memcached::Managed->new( inactive => 1 );

Create a new Cache::Memcached::Managed object.  If there are less than two
input parameters, then the input parameter is assumed to be the value of
the "data" field, with a default of '127.0.0.1:11211'.  If there are more
than one input parameter, the parameters are assumed to be a hash with the
following fields:

=over 2

=item data

 data => '127.0.0.1:11211,127.0.0.1:11212',

 data => ['127.0.0.1:11211','127.0.0.1:11212'],

 data => {
  servers => ['127.0.0.1:11211','127.0.0.1:11212'],
  debug   => 1,
 },

 data => $memcached,

The specification of the memcached server backend(s) for the L<"data server">.
It should either be:

 - string with comma seperated memcached server specification
 - list ref with memcached server specification
 - hash ref with Cache::Memcached object specification
 - blessed object adhering to the Cache::Memcached API

There is no default for this field, it B<must> be specified.  The blessed
object can later be obtained with the L<data> method.

=item delimiter

 delimiter => ';',    # default: '#'

Specify the delimiter to be used in key generation.  Should only be specified
if you expect L<key>, L<ID>, L<version> or L<namespace> values to contain the
character '#'.  Can be any character that will not be part of L<key>, L<ID>,
L<version> or L<namespace> values.

The current delimiter can be obtained with the L<delimiter> method.

Using the null byte (I<\\0>) is not advised at this moment, as there are
some encoding issues within L<Cache::Memcached> regarding null bytes.

=item directory

 directory => '127.0.0.1:11311,127.0.0.1:11312',

 directory => ['127.0.0.1:11311','127.0.0.1:11312'],

 directory => {
  servers => ['127.0.0.1:11311','127.0.0.1:11312'],
  debug   => 1,
 },

 directory => $memcached,

The specification of the memcached server backend(s) for the
L<"directory server">.  It should either be:

 - string with comma seperated memcached server specification
 - list ref with memcached server specification
 - hash ref with Cache::Memcached object specification
 - blessed object adhering to the Cache::Memcached API

If this field is not specified, the L<"data server"> object will be assumed.
The blessed object can later be obtained with the L<directory> method.

=item expiration

 expiration => '1H',   # default: '1D'

The specification of the default L<expiration>.  The following postfixes
can be specified:

 - S seconds
 - M minutes
 - H hours
 - D days
 - W weeks

The default default expiration is one day ('1D').  The default expiration will
be used whenever no expiration has been specified with L<add>, L<decr>,
L<incr>, L<replace> or L<set>.  The default expiration can be obtained
with the L<expiration> method.

=item flush_interval

 flush_interval => 10,   # default: none

The specification of the default interval between which memcached servers
will be flushed with L<flush_all>.  No interval will be used by default
if not specified.

=item group_names

 group_names => [qw(foo bar)],   # default: ['group']

The specification of allowable group names.  Should be specified as a list
reference to the allowable group names.  Defaults to one element list reference
with 'group' only.

Any group name can be specified, as long it consists of alphanumeric characters
and does not interfere with other functions.  Currently disallowed name are:

 - data
 - delete
 - directory
 - expiration
 - id
 - group_names
 - namespace

There is hardly any penalty for using a lot of different group names in itself.
However, linking cached information to a lot of different groups B<does> have
a penalty.

=item inactive

 inactive => 1,

Indicate that the object is inactive.  If this is specified, an instantiated
object is returned with the same API as Cache::Memcached::Managed, but which
will not do anything.  Intended to be uses in situations where no active
memcached servers can be reached: all code will then function as if there
are no cached values in the cache.

=item memcached_class

  memcached_class => 'Cached::Memcached::Fast',

By default, this module uses the L<Cache::Memcached> class as a C<memcached>
client.  Recently, other implementations have been developed, such as
L<Cache::Memcached::Fast>, that are considered to be API compatible.  To be
able to use these other implementation of the memcached client, you can
specify the name of the class to be used.  By default, C<Cache::Memcached>
will be assumed: the module will be loaded automatically if not loaded already.

=item namespace

 namespace => 'foo',   # default: $> ($EUID)

The specification of the default L<namespace> to be used with L<set>, L<incr>,
L<decr>, L<add>, L<replace>, L<get>, L<get_multi>, L<group>, L<get_group> and
L<grab_group>.  Defaults to the effective user ID of the process, as
indicated by $> ($EUID).

=back

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

The following object methods are available (in alphabetical order):

=head2 add

 $cache->add( $value );

 $cache->add( $value, $id );

 $cache->add( $value, $id, $expiration );

 $cache->add( value      => $value,
              id         => $id,     # optional
              key        => $key,    # optional

              expiration => '3H',    # optional
              version    => '1.0',   # optional
              namespace  => 'foo',   # optional
            );

Add a value to the cache, but only if it doesn't exist yet.  Otherwise the
same as L<set>.

=head2 data

 my $data = $cache->data;

Returns the data server object as specified with L<new>.

=head2 dead

 my @dead = $cache->dead;

 my $dead = $cache->dead; # hash ref

Returns the memcached backend L<servers> that appear to be non-functional.
In list context returns the specifications of the servers in alphabetical
order.  Returns a hash reference in scalar context, where the unresponsive
servers are the keys.  Call L<errors> to obtain the number of errors that
were found for each memcached server.

=head2 decr

 $cache->decr;

 $cache->decr( $value );

 $cache->decr( $value, $id, $expiration );

 $cache->decr( value      => $value,  # default: 1
               id         => $id,     # default: key only
               key        => $key,    # default: caller environment
               expiration => '3H',    # default: $cache->expiration
               version    => '1.0',   # default: key environment
               namespace  => 'foo',   # default: $cache->namespace
             );

Decrement a value to the cache, but only if it already exists.  Otherwise the
same as L<set>.  Default for value is B<1>.

Please note that any L<group|"group management"> associations will B<never>
be honoured: it is assumed they would be all the same for all calls to this
counter and are therefore set only with L<set>, L<add> or L<incr>.

=head2 delete

 $cache->delete;

 $cache->delete( $id );

 $cache->delete( id        => $id,     # optional
                 key       => $key,    # optional
                 version   => '1.0',   # optional
                 namespace => 'foo',   # optional
               );

Delete a value, associated with the specified L<"data key">, from the cache.
Can be called with unnamed and named parameters (assumed if two or more
input parameters given).  If called with unnamed parameters, then they are:

=over 2

=item 1 id

The L<ID> to be used to identify the value to be deleted.  Defaults to no ID
(then uses L<key> only).

=back

When using named parameters, the following names can be specified:

=over 2

=item id

The L<ID> to be used to identify the value to be deleted.  Defaults to no ID
(then uses L<key> only).

=item key

The L<key> to be used to identify the value to be deleted.  Defaults to the
default key (as determined by the caller environment).

=item version

The L<version> to be used to identify the value to be deleted.  Defaults to
the version associated with the L<key>.

=item namespace

The L<namespace> to be used to identify the value to be deleted.  Defaults to
the default namespace associated with the object.

=back

=head2 delete_group

 my $deleted = $cache->delete_group( group => 'foo' );

Deletes all cached information related to one or more given groups (specified
as name and ID value pairs) and returns how many items were actually deleted.

=head2 delimiter

 my $delimiter = $cache->delimiter;

Returns the delimiter as (implicitely) specified with L<new>.

=head2 directory

 my $directory = $cache->directory;

Returns the directory cache object as (implicitely) specified with L<new>.

=head2 errors

 my $errors = $cache->errors( "reset" );
 foreach ($cache->servers) {
     print "Found $errors->{$_} errors for $_\n" if exists $errors->{$_};
 }

Return a hash reference with the number of errors when storing data values
in a memcached backend server.  Use L<dead> to find out whether a server is
not responding.  A true value for the input parameter indicates that the
error counts should be reset.

=head2 expiration

 $expiration = $cache->expiration;

Returns the default expiration as (implicitely) specified with L<new>.

=head2 flush_all

 my $flushed = $cache->flush_all;

 my $flushed = $cache->flush_all( 30 ); # flush with 30 second intervals

Initialize contents of all of the memcached backend servers of the
L<"data server">.  The input parameter specifies interval between flushes
of backend memcached servers, default is the L<flush_interval> value
implicitely) specified with L<new>.  Returns whether all memcached L<servers>
were succesfully flushed.

Please note that this method returns immediately after instructing each of
the memcached servers.  Also note that the timed flush_all functionality has
only recently become part of the standard memcached API (starting from
publicly released version C<1.2.1>). See the file "flush_interval.patch" for
a patch for release 1.1.12 of the memcached software that implements timed
flush_all functionality.

=head2 flush_interval

 my $interval = $cache->flush_interval;

Returns the default flush interval values used with L<flush_all>, as
(implicitely) specified with L<new>.

=head2 get

 my $value = $cache->get;

 my $value = $cache->get( $id );

 my $value = $cache->get( id        => $id,     # optional
                          key       => $key,    # optional
                          version   => '1.0',   # optional
                          namespace => 'foo',   # optional
                        );

Obtain a value, associated with a L<"data key">, from the cache.  Can be called
with unnamed and named parameters.  If called with unnamed parameters, then
these are:

=over 2

=item 1 id

The L<ID> to be used to identify the value to be fetched.  Defaults to no ID
(then uses the default L<key> only).

=back

When using named parameters, the following names can be specified:

=over 2

=item id

The L<ID> to be used to identify the value to be fetched.  Defaults to no ID
(then uses L<key> only).

=item key

The L<key> to be used to identify the value to be fetched.  Defaults to the
default key (as determined by the caller environment).

=item version

The L<version> to be used to identify the value to be deleted.  Defaults to
the version associated with the L<key>.

=item namespace

The L<namespace> to be used to identify the value to be deleted.  Defaults to
the default namespace associated with the object.

=back

=head2 get_group

 my $group = $cache->get_group(
  group     => $groupname,
  namespace => $namespace,   # default: $cache->namespace
 );
 foreach my $key (sort keys %{$group}) {
   print "key: $key\n"
   my $versions = $group->{$key};
   foreach my $version (sort keys %{$versions}) {
     print "  version: $version\n";
     my $ids = $versions->{$version};
     foreach my $id (sort keys %{$ids}) {
       print "    id: $ids->{$id}\n";
     }
   }
 }

 my @value = $cache->get_group(
  group     => $groupname,
  namespace => $namespace,   # default: $cache->namespace
 );

Either returns a reference to a multi level hash for the given group name and
ID (containing the group's data) in scalar context, or a list with values
(regardless of key, version or id) in list context.

The input parameters are a hash that should contain the group name and
associated ID, with an optional namespace specification.

The structure of the returned hash reference is:

 $result
  |--- key
        |-- version
            |-- id
                |-- value

See L<"group management"> for more information about groups.  See
L<grab_group> for obtaining the group and deleting it at the same time.

=head2 get_multi

 my $hash = $cache->get_multi( \@id );

 my $hash = $cache->get_multi(
  id        => \@id,
  key       => $key,
  namespace => $namespace,
 );

Optimized way of obtaining multiple values, associated with the same key,
from the cache.  Returns a hash reference with values found, keyed to the
associated L<ID>.

Can be called with named and unnamed parameters.  If called with unnamed
parameters, the parameters are:

=over 2

=item 1 id

A list reference of L<ID>'s to be used to identify the values to be fetched.
Must be specified.

=back

When using named parameters, the following names can be specified:

=over 2

=item id

A list reference of L<ID>'s to be used to identify the values to be fetched.
Must be specified.

=item key

The L<key> to be used to identify the values to be fetched.  Defaults to the
default key (as determined by the caller environment).

=item namespace

The L<namespace> for which to fetch values.  Defaults to the namespace that
was (implicitely) specified with L<new>.

=back

=head2 grab_group

 my $group = $cache->grab_group(
  group     => $groupname,
  namespace => $namespace,   # default: $cache->namespace
 );

Same as L<get_group>, but removes the returned data from the cache at the
same time.

=head2 group

 my $group = $cache->group(
  group     => $groupname,
  namespace => $namespace,   # default: $cache->namespace
 );
 foreach my $key (sort keys %{$group}) {
     print "key: $key\n"
     print " ids: @{$group->{$key}}\n";
 }

Return a reference to a multi level hash for the given group name and ID.
The input parameters are a hash that should contain the group name and
associated ID, with an optional namespace specification.

The structure of the hash is:

 $result
  |--- key
        |--- [id1,id2..idN]

See L<"group management"> for more information about groups.

=head2 group_names

 my @group_name = $cache->group_names;
 
 my $group_names = $cache->group_names; # hash ref

Returns the valid group names as (implicitely) specified with L<new>.  Returns
them in alphabetical order if called in a list context, or as a hash ref if
called in scalar context.

=head2 inactive

 print "Inactive!\n" if $cache->inactive;

Returns whether the cache object is inactive.  This happens if a true value
is specified with L<new>.

=head2 incr

 $cache->incr;

 $cache->incr( $value );

 $cache->incr( $value, $id );

 $cache->incr( $value, $id, $expiration );

 $cache->incr( value      => $value,  # default: 1
               id         => $id,     # default: key only
               key        => $key,    # default: caller environment
               expiration => '3H',    # default: $cache->expiration
               version    => '1.0',   # default: key environment
               namespace  => 'foo',   # default: $cache->namespace
               group      => 'bar',   # default: none
             );

Increment a value to the cache.  Otherwise the same as L<set>.  Default for
value is B<1>.

Differently from the incr() of L<Cache::Memcached>, this increment function
is magical in the sense that it automagically will L<add> the counter if it
doesn't exist yet.

Please note that any L<group|"group management"> associations will only be
set when the counter is created (and will be ignored in any subsequent
increments of the same counter).

=head2 namespace

 my $namespace = $cache->namespace;

Obtain the default namespace, as (implicitely) specified with L<new>.

=head2 replace

 $cache->replace( $value );

 $cache->replace( $value, $id );

 $cache->replace( $value, $id, $expiration );

 $cache->replace( value      => $value,  # undef
                  id         => $id,     # default: key only
                  key        => $key,    # default: caller environment
                  expiration => '3H',    # default: $cache->expiration
                  version    => '1.0',   # default: key environment
                  namespace  => 'foo',   # default: $cache->namespace
                );

Replace a value to the cache, but only if it already exists.  Otherwise the
same as L<set>.

Please note that any L<group|"group management"> associations will B<never>
be honoured: it is assumed they would be all the same for all calls to this
counter and are therefore set only with L<set>, L<add> or L<incr>.

=head2 reset

 $cache->reset;

Resets the client side of the cache system.  Mainly for internal usage only.
Always returns true.

=head2 servers

 my @backend = $cache->servers;

 my $backend = $cache->servers; # hash ref

Returns the configuration details of the memcached backend servers that are
currently configured to be used.  Returns a list in alphabetical order in
list context, and a hash ref in scalar context.

See also L<dead> to find out if any of the memcached backend servers are
not responding.

=head2 set

 $cache->set;

 $cache->set( $value );

 $cache->set( $value,$id );

 $cache->set( $value, $id, $expiration );

 $cache->set( value      => $value,  # default: undef
              id         => $id,     # default: key only
              key        => $key,    # default: caller environment
              expiration => '3H',    # default: $cache->expiration

            );

Set a value in the cache, regardless of whether it exists already or not.

Can be called with named or unnamed parameters (if called with two input
parameters or less).  If called with unnamed parameters, then the input
parameters are:

=over 2

=item 1 value

The value to set in the cache.  Defaults to C<undef>.

=item 2 id

The L<ID> to be used to identify the value.  Defaults to no ID (then uses
L<key> only).

=item 3 expiration

The expiration of the value.  Defaults to the value as specified with
L<expiration> for the L<key>.

=back

With named input parameters, the following names and values can be specified
as a hash (in alphabetical order).

=over 2

=item expiration

The expiration time in seconds of the given value.  Defaults to the value as
specified with L<expiration> for the L<key>.  Values below 30*24*60*60 (30
days) will be considered to be relative to the current time.  Other values
will be assumed to be absolute epoch times (seconds since 1 Jan. 1970 GMT).
See L<"expiration specification"> for more ways to set expiration.

=item id

The L<ID> to be used to identify the value.  Defaults to no ID (then uses
L<key> only).

=item key

The L<key> to be used to identify the value.  Defaults to the default key
(as determined by the caller environment).  Can be specified as a relative
key when prefixed with "::", so that "::bar" would refer to the key "Foo::bar"
if called from the package "Foo".

=item namespace

The L<namespace> to which to associate the value.  Defaults to the namespace
that was (implicitely) specified with L<new>.

=item value

The value to set in the cache.  Defaults to C<undef>.

=item version

The L<version> to be used to identify the value to be set.  Defaults to
the version associated with the L<key>.

=back

Other than these named parameters, any number of group name and ID pairs can
be specified to indicate a link to that group.

=head2 start

 my $started_ok = $cache->start;

 my $started_ok = $cache->start( $config );

Attempts to start the memcached servers that have been configured with L<new>
(and which can be find out with L<servers>) by default, or the servers with
the specified configs.  Returns whether all servers (implicitely) specified
have been started successfully.

This only works if the memcached server(s) will be running on the same
physical hardware as the script is running (which will generally not be
the case in a production environment).  It is therefore of limited
usage generally, but it is a handy feature to have if you're developing
or testing.

See also L<stop>.

=head2 stats

 my $stats = $cache->stats;

Return a hash ref with simple statistics of all of the memcached backend
L<servers>.  The structure of the hash ref is as follows:

 $stats
   |-- server specification
        |-- key
             |-- value

See the memcached server documentation on possible keys and values.

=head2 stop

 my $stopped = $cache->stop;

 my $stopped = $cache->stop( $config );

Attempts to stop the specified memcached L<servers> (as specified by config
value), returns whether all servers have actually stopped.  Defaults to
stopping all servers as initially specified with L<new>.

This only works if the memcached server(s) are running on the same
physical hardware as the script is running (which will generally not be
the case in a production environment).  It is therefore of limited
usage generally, but it is a handy feature to have if you're developing
or testing.

See also L<start>.

=head2 version

 my $version = $cache->version; # hash ref

 my $version = $cache->version( $config ); # hash ref

Obtain the version information of the specified memcached servers, or all
memcached servers being used if no input parameters are specified.  Returns
a hash reference in which the keys are the config information of the servers
used (as returned by L<servers>) and the values are the version information
of the associated memcached server.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 generic grouped event logging

 $cache->set( group => 'event1',
              id    => ':unique',
              value => $value
            );

This would put the value C<$value> into the cache, linked to the group
'event1'.  Since we're not interested in the id of the event, but want to
make sure it is always unique, the pseudo id ':unique' is specified.

A recurring proces, usually a cron job, would then need to do the following
to grab all of the values cached:

 my @value = $cache->grab_group( group => 'event1' );
 foreach (@value) {
 # perform whatever you want to do with the value in C<$_>
 }

Please not that only the values are returned because L<grab_group> is called
in list context.

=head2 generic content logging

 my $cache = Cache::Memcached::Managed->new(
  data        => $servers,
  group_names => [qw(hotel_id room_id)],
  expiration  => '1H',
 );
 package Foo;
 sub available {
   my ($cache,$hotel_id,$room_id,$checkin,$checkout) = @_;
   my $available;
   unless ($available = $cache->get( id => [$room_id,$checkin,$checkout] )) {
 # perform complicated calculations setting C<$available>
     $cache->set( id       => [$room_id,$checkin,$checkout],
                  value    => $available,
                  room_id  => $room_id,
                  hotel_id => $hotel_id,
                );
   }
   return $available;
 } #available

This example shows availability caching in a specific subroutine.  Because
the L<get> and the L<set> are located in de same subroutine, it is not
necessary to specify the L<key> (which will be automatically set to
"Foo::available").

Please also not the absence of a L<namespace> specification.  Since each
user of the "available" subroutine should have its "realm" depending on the
cache object, no namespace specification is done.

Now, whenever something related to the hotel_id is changed, a simple:

 $cache->delete_group( hotel_id => $hotel_id );

would be enough to also remove any availability cached in the above example
(for the same value of C<$hotel_id>).

The same would apply when something related to the room_id is changed: a
simple:

 $cache->delete_group( room_id => $room_id );

would be enough to also remove any availability cached in the above example
(for the same value of C<$room_id>).

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Race Conditions

Several race conditions exists that can not be fixed because of a lack of
semaphores when using memcached.

Most important race condition is when a group is deleted: between the moment
the main pointer ("directory key") is reset and all of the index keys are
removed, it is possible for another process to be adding information to the
same directory key already.  In a worst case scenario, this means that a
data key can get lost.

To prevent this, a delay of B<2> seconds is applied to each time a group
is deleted.  This should give some time for the cleaning process to clean
up before other processes start accessing again, but it is no way a guarantee
that other processes wouldn't be able to add information if the cleaning
process needs more than 2 seconds to clean up.

=head2 Cron jobs

Because the L<"data key">s by default includes the user id (uid) of the
process as the L<namespace> with which the entry was stored in the cache,
cron jobs (which usually run under a different user id) will need to set
the namespace to the user id of the process storing information into the
cache.

=head2 Incompatibility with Cache module

John Goulah pointed out to me that there is an inconsistency with unnamed
parameter passing in respect to the L<Cache> module.  Specifically, the
C<set> method:

 $c->set( $key, $data, [ $expiry ] );

is incompatible with this module's C<set> method:

 $cache->set;

 $cache->set( $value );

 $cache->set( $value, $id );

 $cache->set( $value, $id, $expiration );

The reason for this simple: in this module, B<all> parameters are optional.
So you can specify just a value: the key will be generated for you from the
caller environment.  Since I felt at the time that you would more likely
specify a value than a key, I made that the first parameter (as opposed to
the C<set> method of L<Cache>.  Changing to the format as imposed by the
L<Cache> module, is not an option at this moment in the lifetime of this
module, as it would break existing code (the same way as it breaks the
test-suite).

=head1 THEORY OF OPERATION

The group management is implemented by keeping a type of directory information
in a (seperate) directory memcached server.

For each L<group|"group management"> one directory key is maintained in the
directory memcached server.  This key consists of the string
"Cache::Memcached::Managed::", appended with the L<namespace>, group name,
the L<delimiter> and the ID of the group.  For instance, the directory key
for the group

 group => 'foo'

when running as user "500" would be:

 Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo

The value of the directory key of a group is used as a counter.  Each time
a some content is added that is linked to the group, that counter will be
incremented and its value prepended to create an C<"index key">.  So the
first index key of the above example, would be:

 1#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo

This index key is then also stored in the directory memcached server, with
the original L<"data key"> as its value, and with the same expiration as used
for the data key.

Whenever the index keys are needed of a group (e.g. for fetching all of its
members, or for deleting all of its members), the value of the directory key
of the group is inspected, and that is used to generate a list of index keys.
Suppose the value of the directory key is 5, then then following index keys
would be generated (essentially mapping 1..5):

 1#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo
 2#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo
 3#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo
 4#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo
 5#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo

If the group is to be deleted or fetched, then all possible values for these
index keys are obtained.  For instance, this would fetch:

 1#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo => 500#1.0#Foo::zip#23
 2#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo => 500#1.1#Bar::pod#47
 3#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo => 500#1.0#Foo::zip#23
 4#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo => 500#1.1#Bar::pid#12
 5#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo => 500#1.1#Bar::pid#14

Note that index key 1 and 3 return the same backend key.  This can be caused
by doing multiple sets with the same key / id combination.  The final list of
backend keys then becomes:

 500#1.0#Foo::zip#23
 500#1.1#Bar::pod#47
 500#1.1#Bar::pid#12
 500#1.1#Bar::pid#14

If the group is to be deleted (L<delete_group>), then the index keys are
removed from the directory memcached server.  And the associated data
keys are removed from the data memcached server.

If the group (data) is to be fetched (L<group> or L<get_group>), then the
superfluous index keys are removed from the directory memcached server.
In this example, that would be:

 1#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo

because:

 3#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo

also refers to the data key

 500#1.0#Foo::zip#23

Because of this, the lowest index key with a valid data key has become:

 2#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo

making "2" the lowest ordinal number of the index keys.  In that case a
special key, the lowest index key, is saved in the directory memcached
server.  The name of the keys is the same as the directory key for the group,
postfixed with the L<delimiter> and the string "_lowest".  In this example,
this would be:

 Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo#_lowest

Whenever index keys are fetched, the value of this key is used to determine
the start point for the generation of index keys.  If, in the above example
another fetch of that group would be done, then these index_keys would be
generated (essentially mapping 2..5):

 2#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo
 3#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo
 4#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo
 5#Cache::Memcached::Managed#500#group#foo

Since 32 bit counters are being used, about 4 billion items can be linked
to a group, before a group should be deleted to completely restart.  In most
live situation, this overflow condition will not occur, since this mechanism
was mainly intended to be able to delete groups of information from the cache.
And a deletion will remove the counter and all of its associated keys,
essentially starting again at 1.
