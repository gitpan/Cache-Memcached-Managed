=head1 NAME

Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi - multiple Cache::Memcache::Managed objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi;

 my $multi = Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi->new( @managed );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the same API as L<Cache::Memcached::Managed>, but applies all methods
called to all of the objects specified, except for L<new> and L<objects>.

=head1 CONTEXT

All methods are called on all of the L<Cache::Memcached::Managed> objects
in the same context (list, scalar or void) in which the method is called on
the L<Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi> object.  The return value differs in
format depending on the context also:

=over 2

=item scalar

 my $listref = $multi->method;
 print "Result: @{$listref}\n";

When called in scalar context, a list ref with scalar values is returned in
the same order in which the objects are used (which is determined by the
order in which they were supplied with L<new> and returned by L<objects>..

=item list

 my @listref = $multi->method;
 print "Result $_: @{$listref[$_]}\n" foreach 0..$#listref;

When called in list context, a list of list references is returned in
the same order in which the objects are used (which is determined by the
order in which they were supplied with L<new> and returned by L<objects>.

=item void

 $multi->method;

When called in void context, nothing is returned (not strangely enough ;-).

=back

=head1 SPECIFIC CLASS METHODS

There is only one specific class method.

=head2 new

 my $multi = Cache::Memcached::Managed::Multi->new( @managed );

Create an object containing multiple L<Cache::Memcached::Managed> objects.
Returns the instantiated object.

=head1 SPECIFIC INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 objects

 my @managed = $multi->objects;

Returns the list of instantiated L<Cache::Memcached::Managed> objects that
the object is a proxy for.
